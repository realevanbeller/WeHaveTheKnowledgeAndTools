# Manifesto

- Legibility over polish — clarity beats aesthetics.
- Process over personalities — systems are accountable.
- Receipts over rhetoric — link to evidence.
- Progress over perfection — show iteration.
- Public by default — private only when required.

Every page answers: "Can a normal person understand what is happening and why?"
