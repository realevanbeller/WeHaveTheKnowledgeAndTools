# If in office — IMMEDIATELY

This is a short checklist of direct, executable steps I would do on day 1–100 (examples):

1. Issue a transparency executive memo — publish all active requests and workflows.
2. Stand up a two-person rapid-response team for permits and critical business intake.
3. Publish a 30/60/90 day public scoreboard and commit to weekly updates.
